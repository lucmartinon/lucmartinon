## Euros For docs

#### <a href="https://eurosfordocs.fr" target="_blank">eurosfordocs.fr</a>
Euros For Docs is a project that started in France, to facilitate the access to the french transparency register (Base Transparence Santé), where drug companies are obliged to publish their financial ties to doctors.
The project was launched in 2018 by Pierre-Alain Jachiet, inspired by the american project <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/" target="_blank">dollarsfordocs</a> from ProPublica.

In 2022 the format of the Transparence Santé register was updated, which broke the data ingestion. I am currently working on updating the project to work with the new data format, as well as adding the possibility to see the update history of each record in the register.

I joined the project in 2020 to develop the European version of the project: <a href="https://eurosfordocs.eu" target="_blank">eurosfordocs.eu</a>
In most European countries, there is no public register of financial ties between the drug industry and health actors. The only available sources are the disclosure documents voluntarily published by drug companies, in the frame of an auto-regulation framework is designed to be impractical to use. The project consisted in listing these disclosure documents (mostly PDFs), to extract their data and to make it available in a single database, available to journalist and researchers.
