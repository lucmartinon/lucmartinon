# Carbon credits
I analysed the data of a EU regiser (the [EU ETS](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en): emissions trading system) to investigate how much credit were given to companies or exchanged, bought and sold by them. The investigation foccused on oncrete and steel sectors. The global picture is that the amount of free carbot credits that was given to these companies until 2012 was incredibly high. This is not the case anymore, but companies sit on such a pile of credtis that they were able to use them to delay the reduction of their carbon emissions, or to sell them at a high price. 

The investigation was published [in France by Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2023/05/30/comment-les-entreprises-polluantes-ont-transforme-les-quotas-gratuits-de-co-en-un-marche-de-plusieurs-milliards-d-euros_6175369_3244.html) and [in Spain by El Diario](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/derecho-contaminar-medida-medioambiental-convirtio-fiasco-miles-millones-euros_1_10240066.html).
