# PFAS Data Hub

![pdh_logo](/assets/images/pdh_logo_bandeau.png)



The data gathered for the [Forever Pollution Project](/pages/projects/pfas.html) was interesting for many research projects, and triggered the curiousity of the french public research center CNRS. I am now working with them on a follow-up project, which aims at:
* making the data more robust, and easier to re-use,
* maintain the project on the long term, especially by automating recurring data collection from regular sources,
* offer a website where the data can be consulted, possibly with new functionalities. 

I am leading the tech side of this project for the CNRS, it is avaible at [pdh.cnrs.fr](https://pdh.cnrs.fr){:target="_blank"}
