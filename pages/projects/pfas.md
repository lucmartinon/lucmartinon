## The forever pollution project

<a href="https://foreverpollution.eu/" target="_blank">The forever pollution project</a> is an in-depth cross-border investigation made by 13 European media outlets about PFAS, a persistant chemical pollution that is present virtually everywhere in Europe with little to no public attention so far.

The team worked for months on gathering existing data on measured PFAS contamination levels, and on sites which are certainly contaminated, but where no measure was available. The result was a list of 100+ datasets with PFAS contamination values and suspected sites, my task was to unify their format to be able to have a single list of the contamination sites, which was then put on <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2023/02/23/forever-pollution-explore-the-map-of-europe-s-pfas-contamination_6016905_8.html" target="_blank">a map</a>.
