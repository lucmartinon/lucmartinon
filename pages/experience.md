#### Investigative data-journalist | Since 2024 | Berlin
Launched in 2024, [CORRECTIV.Europe](https://correctiv.org/en/europe/) is a network of local journalists acorss Europe. The team investigates a topic at european level, often based on data (public register, FOI documents, etc.). Instead of directly publishing our finding, we present them to the network of local journalists, who then complete the investigation, researching the local consequences and enriching our first findings. 

Topics treated so far: 
* May 2024: Industrial air pollution, based on the data of the [EPRTR](https://industry.eea.europa.eu/#/home). 
* October 2024: The impact of climate change on Europe's need for cooling and heating. Based on data from the [Joint Research Center](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/nrg_chdd_esms.htm).
* February 2025: Freezing europe. Maping households difficulty to heat their homes properly. Based on Eurostat [SILC data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ilc_mdes01_r/default/table?lang=en).
